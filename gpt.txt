yaa and i am planning to write it with python and it's custom tkinter module, and it may follow a beautifull white & clean look , first must be the project manager which will have a project.json file where it will store the information about all the created projects including there paths and if a project is not found on the given path then the project manager must throw an error for "Project not found" and if the project is present on the path it must represented by project.meta.json in the project path this file will tell the editor everything about the project and this will be also responsible for project loading for project manager , Project manager must also allow creating and editing and deleting projects and editor will include a file browser on the left side and the file explorer must allow , create, delete and rename file operations and same as with create , delete and renaming folders and this file browser will also allow to open folders and files when they are clicked the folder will show there content in file browser and  files will show there content in text editor panel which will be placed just after the text box and on the bottom there must be a console section where developers can see alll the console outputs and execute system commands and on top there must be buttons for saving , opening, creating and managing files
